## 🔬 A/B Testing for Fraud Prevention
A/B testing is an essential component of fraud risk assessment. The script includes a **simulated A/B test** that:

🔹 Compares the **new fraud detection model** with an **existing baseline policy**.  
🔹 Uses **statistical hypothesis testing** to measure fraud prevention improvements.  
🔹 Assesses the business impact of fraud detection policies before full deployment.

## 🎯 Making Fraud Predictions

Once the fraud detection model is trained, it can be used to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The model analyzes transaction features and determines fraud probability based on learned patterns from historical data.

🔹 **Real-time fraud prediction**: The model can be integrated into payment processing systems to flag suspicious transactions instantly.  
🔹 **Batch processing**: Large datasets can be analyzed to detect fraudulent patterns across multiple transactions.  
🔹 **Threshold customization**: Users can adjust fraud detection sensitivity based on business needs, reducing false positives and improving accuracy.  
🔹 **Business impact**: Fraud predictions help organizations minimize financial losses, prevent chargebacks, and enhance overall security.  

By continuously monitoring fraud trends and retraining the model with new data, businesses can improve fraud detection accuracy over time and stay ahead of evolving fraud techniques.
